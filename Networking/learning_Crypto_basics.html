                When we communicate with others, we want the info to be mostly secure, 
                that no one in the middle can read it.
                For example, while we use our personal detail for shopping, such as credit card 
                details or home address. 
            </p> 
            <p class="text-indent">
                common terms are encrypt, decrypt.
                scrambing the message first (encrpyt) and second getting the message back (decrypt).
                using a secret called a key.
            </p>
            <p class='text-indent'
            When we transmit using ssl enabled algorithm, such as https, all the info is first encrypted before 
            getting transmitted.

            Two broad categories for accomplish such secured communication using encrpyt and decrypt technuques.

                With symmetric cryptography algorithms, same key is used to encrpyt, and decrypt.In this type sender and receiver
                should have a common understanding what the key is. creating, exchanging, and keeping this key as secret could be difficult.
                common category of symmetric encryption algorithm is the block cipher algorithm, 
                which operates on a fixed range of bytes rather than on a single character at a time. 3 commonly known ones are:
                <ol>
                    <li type="1">
                        DES : smaller key length, brute force could work
                    </li>
                    <li type="1">
                        3DES : slower than DES as key length is 3 times (56*3=  168 bit)
                    </li>
                    <li type="1">
                        AES: Faster 
                    </li>
                </ol>
