                <h2>Levels and Layers of Abstraction in Linux.</h2>
                <p>A Linux system has three main levels.
                    <ul>
                        <li >Hardware is at the base -includes memory,CPU,etc
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            next level up is the Kernel-which is core of OS.It is a software residing in memory.
                            it acts as mediator b/w hardware and running program.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Processes-running programs that kernel manages.this upper level also called as User space.
                            ex-web server
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kernel runs in Kernel mode, user process runs in user mode.Code running in kernel mode has unrestricted access 
                    to the processor and main memory. This is a powerful but dangerous privilege that allows the kernel to easily 
                    corrupt and crash the entire system. The memory area that only the kernel can access is called kernel space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    User mode, in comparison, restricts access to a (usually quite small) subset of memory and safe CPU operations. 
                    User space refers to the parts of main memory that the user processes can access. If a process makes a mistake and
                     crashes, the consequences are limited and can be cleaned up by the kernel. This means that if your web browser crashes,
                     it probably wonâ€™t take down the scientific computation that has been running in the background for days.
